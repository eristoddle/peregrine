An ecommerce platform written in the Phalcon PHP framework for Learning Phalcon PHP published by Packt Publishing.

The project contains a vagrant file which will pull down an ubuntu 14.04 32bit box and install all necessary software for the project. Run 'vagrant up' in main folder and project can be tested in browser at http://192.168.33.10.

I had to drop publishing this book and stop working on this application. If anyone wants to contribute, I wouldn't mind getting back to this project sometime to build an actual ecommerce platform in Phalcon. I just do not have the time right now.
